here is a basic plot summary: okay so story: 1. they are building the robots with the zombies approaching 
2. there's a huge battle in the cafeteria, MSW, Charlie, and Gordie are clearly the leaders here until the three of them get eaten / turned into zombies 
3. the kids take over and use their knowledge of the school to fend for themselves and make weapons, here Nathaniel takes charge and makes something batman related. 
	Liam volunteers to go find the zombies and he gets eaten 
4. the final battle takes place and the children are victorious, because the zombies who turned them die everyone comes back and they're all one big happy family.

Dunno where Charlie, we'll figure that out later.

uber drivers became zombies. This is where it all starts

Possible robot designs: 
robot with a big stomper (literally a giant hammer on an arm)
cannonbot that shoots the zombies

Remember, don't get too dark

Charlie, MSW, and Gordie were eaten...


Setting:
Students have left the fifth floor and are now assembled in the cafeteria, putting the finishing touches on their robots. The building is getting hotter as the zombies are getting closer and burning their way through the city. Gordie is reading the newspaper in the corner unaware of the current situation. MSW is walking around yelling "build robots faster." People are still unaware as to what happened to Davis. Julian follows his screams down to the end of the 5th floor, he runs after Davis to find him on the floor, tears in his eyes. Julian preparing for the worst says,

Julian: Davis, what happened?

Davis (his bottom lip trembling): Something tickled me!  

Julian, knowing the pain that Davis has endured rushes to his side, and helps him up. Suddenly a crash erupts from behind them. They rush back to where everyone is congregated telling them that the fifth floor is no longer safe. Charlie suggests the cafeteria and everyone flocks downstairs. Zach and Andrew clinging to the robot, unable to part, or risk its damage. 

Once down in the cafeteria everyone resumes what they were doing, except the fear of the zombies has increased and the freshmen are now balled on the floor sobbing. A slow and steady banging and clomping starts coming up the stairs. Everything seems hopeless and the kids fear for the worst.

Julian says, "guys this is like reaallly reaally bad," in his hispanic accent to try to diffuse the tension, but no one see the humor in his "yoke."

Nathaniel inconspicuously creeps off into the darkness, a clever grin on his face...

Makoto and Daniel, still working on the robot, seem to make a great achievement, but it's too late. The zombies are approaching fast. 

Gordie peers up from his newspaper, finally coming to terms with the situation he rises crying, "it's time."

Charlie: "Bolt the doors, get the robots ready."

As the kids scramble to find anything to bolt the doors with,Ben Rothschild is sitting in the middle of the floor, a clear obstacle playing on his phone, looking up every once in a while to ask "is there anything I can do?."

Dillon (looking up, fear in his eyes): We have left all the tools upstairs, all we brought was a robot cart.

On queue the zombies start banging on the cafeteria doors, screeches erupt while kids fear for their lives. 

MSW: Quick! Disassemble the cart and block the doors.

They close off the cafeteria doors and postpone the zombies' entrance for a little, hoping to buy Mattori and Daniel some time while they fix the robot. Liam shouts, distracted by his desperate need for a power source: "PHONE CHARGER!" very loudly despite fear of attracting more zombies. As everyone tries to shush him, he looks over at a nearby table and finds an iPhone charger directly in front of him.

Just as the door starts breaking Mattori and Daniel figure out how to fix their power issue by hooking it up to Liam's new iPhone charger. Liam very reluctantly gives up his charger almost in tears dramatatically saying: "It is a sacrifice I am...will...ing to make." 

Andrew and Daniel, first passive-aggressively, then very aggressive, fight over who gets to line up their robot before the zombies come, but as they do this MSW, Charlie, and Gordie begin to pry the door open saying "okay, you guys have more than enough time to work, the assessment starts now whether you're ready or not." After a few minutes of struggling, they manage to get the door open and the zombies come pouring out.

The zombies have made their way over to the easiest target, the clump of freshemn on the floor. The room is filled with the sounds of a low growl, coming from the zombies, mixed with the sounds of children screaming, and suddenly a quiet song erupts from the background, as blond zombie erupts into song. Without hesitation Emily joins hands with what she thought to be her former friend Briteny, this potentially life threatening zombie, and starts dancing and singing along with her. Chris begins to dance to the music as he is bored waiting for action.

Gordie tries to hop on his vespa and scooter away, but the ignition just isn't cooperating with him and the zombies overtake him

Charlie realizes that he forgot his century old sourdough in the cafeteria and runs in to get it, he knows that he can't fend off all of the zombies, but he goes in anyways. 

MSW had taken too much cough medicine, in effort to get rid of his fever, and cannot process the situation before it's too late..
