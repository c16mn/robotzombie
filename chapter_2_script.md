Apparently the basic plot of our episode will be a large battle between the robots/humans and the zombies. In the end of the episode, the zombies get through and get someone.
Liam gets kidnapped in episode 1 by another school. 

here is a basic plot summary: okay so story: 1. they are building the robots with the zombies approaching 
2. there's a huge battle in the cafeteria, MSW, Charlie, and Gordie are clearly the leaders here until the three of them get eaten / turned into zombies 
3. the kids take over and use their knowledge of the school to fend for themselves and make weapons, here Nathaniel takes charge and makes something batman related. 
	Liam volunteers to go find the zombies and he gets eaten 
4. the final battle takes place and the children are victorious, because the zombies who turned them die everyone comes back and they're all one big happy family.

Setting:
Students are in the cafeteria, putting the finishing touches on their robots. Gordie is reading the newspaper in the corner. MSW is walking around saying "build robots faster".
Dunno where Charlie, we'll figure that out later.

uber drivers became zombies. This is where it all starts

Possible robot designs: 
robot with a big stomper (literally a giant hammer on an arm)
cannonbot that shoots the zombies

Remember, don't get too dark

Charlie, MSW, and Gordie were eaten...

Everything seems hopeless and the kids fear for the worst.

Julian says, "guys this is like reaallly reaally bad," in his hispanic accent to try to diffuse the tension, but no one see the humor in his "yoke."

	Nathaniel inconspicuously creeps off into the darkness...

Makoto and Daniel, still working on the robot, seem to make a great achievement. 
The kids fear for their lives as the zombies chase them around the cafeteria, but come up with a plan:
They close off the cafeteria doors and lock the zombies inside to buy Mattori and Daniel some time while they are fixing the robot

Finally, in an interesting moment, Mattori and Daniel figure out how to fix their power issue by hooking it up to the special ihone charger that Alex was showing off to everyone

They sit outside the cafeteria with the robots, waiting for the zombies to break through the door

Chris begins to dance as he is bored waiting for the zombies to do something, 
	Ben Rothschild is sitting in the corner playing on his phone, looking up every once in a while to ask "is there anything I can do?"
	Andrew and Daniel, first passive-aggressively, then very aggressive, fight over who gets to line up their robot before the zombies come
MSW, Charlie, and Gordie begin to pry the door open saying "okay, you guys have more than enough time to work, the assessment starts now whether you're ready or not."
	
After a few minutes of struggling, they manage to get the door open and the zombies come pouring out

Gordie tries to hop on his vespa and scooter away, but the ignition just isn't cooperating with him and the zombies overtake him

Charlie realizes that he forgot his century old sourdough in the cafeteria and runs in to get it, he knows that he can't fend off all of the zombies, but he goes in anyways. 

MSW had taken too much cough medicine, in effort to get rid of his fever, and cannot process the situation before it's too late..
